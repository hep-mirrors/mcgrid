MCgrid Interface for Monte Carlo event generators to APPLgrid and fastNLO.
Version: 2.0
Website: http://mcgrid.hepforge.org
Support: mcgrid@projects.hepforge.org

Software Requirements:
	• Rivet version 2.1.2 or later.
	• APPLgrid version 1.4.56 or later and/or fastNLO Toolkit 2.3pre-2125 or

The MCgrid package has been tested with the SHERPA v2.2.X event generator
available at: http://sherpa.hepforge.org/trac/wiki

MCgrid 2.X is not compatible with earlier versions of Sherpa.
Please use MCgrid 1.X for SHERPA 2.0.0-2.2.0.
To enable using Sherpa with MCgrid, you should use
its configuration options --enable-rivet and --enable-hepmc2.

Make sure that the binaries rivet-config, applgrid-config and/or fnlo-tk-config
can be find using your PATH environment variable. Then install the MCgrid
interface:

	./configure [options]
	make && make install

For information on the configuration options, please see the MCgrid manual.

If installing to a nonstandard directory, please ensure that the mcgrid.pc
file is in the PKG_CONFIG_PATH.

Example MCgrid-enhanced analyses may be found on the HepForge page.
