Description:
  The inclusive jet cross section is measured in pp collisions with a center-of-mass
  energy of 7 TeV at the LHC using the CMS experiment. The data sample corresponds to an
  integrated luminosity of 34 inverse picobarns. The measurement is made for jet transverse
  momenta in the range 18-1100 GeV and for absolute values of rapidity less than 3.
  Jets are anti-kt with $R=0.5$, $p_\perp>18$ GeV and $|y|<3.0$.
