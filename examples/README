In this directory, there is an example of
a typical setup for building a MCgrid enabled
Rivet analysis.

The makefile here will compile three analyses,

MCGRID_BASIC.cc - an example analysis with no content.
		  this demonstrates the minimal modifications
		  required to a rivet analysis to enable MCgrid.

MCgrid_CDF_2009_S8383952.cc
		- a modified version of the CDF Z rapidity
		  analysis as standard in Rivet. This analysis
		  will produce two APPLgrid files, one for the
		  total xsec, one for the y distribution.

MCgrid_CMS_2011_S9086218.cc
		- a modification of a CMS inclusive jet analysis.
		  This is intended as a demonstration of the
		  MCGrid::BinnedGrid class, which complements
		  Rivet's BinnedHistogram.

The makefile will also compile a small test program that
performs the applgrid convolution with a selected grid and the CT10
distribution (provided the grid is available via LHAPDF).

make install will install the analyses to the Rivet library directory,
and copy the associated Rivet refdata and APPLgrid subprocess config files.

A test run card for SHERPA is provided in the runcards directory. This runcard
generates events suitable for analysis with MCgrid_CDF_2009_S8383952. Additionally
provided for test purposes is a HepMC record generated by this runcard, this can
be found in /hepmc/.

To produce your own MCgrid enabled analysis, please modify the BASIC
analysis to your requirements.
